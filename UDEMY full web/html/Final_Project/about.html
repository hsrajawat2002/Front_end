                <p id="para">Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, 
                    bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or 
                    round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>
                <p id="para">The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old 
                    French word travail, which means 'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word 
                    travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen 
                    (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler 
                    (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. 
                    According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even 
                    more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). 
                    This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier 
                    depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more 
                    difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even 
                    by bullock cart.</p>
                <p id="para">Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and to 
                    society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user 
                    retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues 
                    (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels 
                    practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars. 
                    Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally 
                    (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally.</p>
