            <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles 
                or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.[1] The theory of general relativity 
                predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[2][3] The boundary 
                of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances
                 of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features.[4] 
                 In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[5][6] Moreover, 
                 quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with 
                 the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature 
                 is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible 
                 to observe directly.</p>
            <p>Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century 
                by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.[7] The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize
                 a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing 
                 can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical 
                 curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general 
                 relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally 
                 collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known as such was Cygnus X-1, 
                 identified by several researchers independently in 1971</p>
